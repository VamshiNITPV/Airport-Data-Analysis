# Indigo Flight - Data Analysis
This project performs an in-depth analysis of airport traffic data to uncover trends in passenger movements, freight, and mail across cities and time periods. Using SQL, it explores metrics like busiest airports, top routes, and correlations with city populations, based on the Airport_Project_Data.csv dataset. The project is designed for researchers, data analysts, and aviation enthusiasts to derive actionable insights from flight data.
